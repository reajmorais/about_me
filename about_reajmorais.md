- 👋 Hi, I’m @reajmorais!
- 👀 I’m interested in building a nice portfolio here on Git and learn a tiny bit every day. Since takes some practice to learn, and I'm just starting, I'll try to submit little projects every now and then.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG). I'm on my first semester on my major, Computing Science.
- 💞️ For now, I need to learn more before start collaborating, but as soon as I feel ready, count me in!
- 📫 Reach me through my e-mail: reajmorais@gmail.com!
