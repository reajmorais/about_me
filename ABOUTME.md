- 👋 Hi, I’m @reajmorais!
- 👀 I’m interested in building a nice portfolio and learn a tiny bit every day.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computing Science at Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG)
- 💞️ For now, I need to learn more before start collaborating, but as soon as I feel ready, count me in!
- 📫 Reach me through my e-mail: reajmorais@gmail.com!
